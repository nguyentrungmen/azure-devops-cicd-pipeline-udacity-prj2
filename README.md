# Overview

In this project, you will build a Github repository from scratch and create a scaffold that helps you do both Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. You'll use Github Actions along with Makefile, requirements.txt, and application code to perform the initial code debugging, testing, and installation cycle. Next, you will integrate this project with Azure Pipelines to enable Continuous Delivery to Azure App Service.

## Project Plan
It is very important to have a project plan and task tracking so in this project we will use Excel spreadsheet and Trello:
